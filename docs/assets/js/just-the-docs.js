MICROCHIP'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED USD$1,000. 12. General. (a) This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Arizona and the United States, without regard to conflicts of law provisions. The parties hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts in Maricopa County, Arizona for any dispute relating to this Agreement. WHERE LICENSEE IS A CONSUMER LOCATED IN EUROPE, this Agreement is subject to the laws of the country in which the Software is downloaded, and, to the extent so mandated by such laws, subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of that country. The parties expressly disclaim the applicability of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods in connection with this Agreement. (b) Unless the parties have a mutually executed agreement relating to the licensing of this Software by Microchip to Licensee (\\\"Signed Agreement\\\"), this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Software, and supersedes and replaces prior or contemporaneous written or verbal agreements or communications between the parties regarding the Software, including any purchase orders. If the parties have a Signed Agreement, this Agreement does not supersede or replace that Signed Agreement. This Agreement will not be modified except by a written agreement signed by an authorized representative of Microchip. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. No waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement constitutes a waiver of any prior, concurrent, or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions of this Agreement, and no waiver will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party. (c) Licensee agrees to comply with all import and export laws and restrictions and regulations of the Department of Commerce or other United States or foreign agency or authority. (d) This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's permitted successors and assigns. Licensee may not assign this Agreement in whole or in part, whether by law or otherwise, without Microchip's prior written consent. Any merger, consolidation, amalgamation, reorganization, transfer of all or substantially all assets or other change in control or majority ownership (\\\"Change of Control\\\") is considered an assignment for the purpose of this Section. Any attempt to assign this Agreement without such consent will be null and void. However, Microchip may assign this Agreement to an affiliate, or to another entity in the event of a Change of Control. (e) Licensee acknowledges its breach of any confidentiality or proprietary rights provision of this Agreement would cause Microchip irreparable damage, for which the award of damages would not be an adequate remedy. Licensee, therefore, agrees if Microchip alleges that Licensee has breached or violated any such provisions then Microchip may seek equitable relief, in addition to all other remedies at law or in equity. (f) Authorized representatives of Microchip shall have the right to reasonably inspect Licensee's premises and to audit Licensee's records and inventory of Licensee Products, whether located on Licensee's premises or elsewhere at any time, announced or unannounced, and in its sole and absolute discretion, in order to ensure Licensee's adherence to the terms of this Agreement.

    "content": "The control algorithm is the same as in the PMSM using an Encoder based Field Oriented Control (FOC) in the SAME70 microcontroller example . An additional algorithm is used to get the currents on phase A and B from the LX7720. A decimation filter is used to convert the sigma delta modulators output from LX7720. Current conversion with decimation filter . The second order sigma delta modulator output of the LX7720 is a noise shaped signal where le low frequency noise is pushed toward the high frequencies. The SAMRH71 provide a 25MHz clock to the LX7720 modulator which in turn generates modulated signals that can be sampled by the SAMRH71. The sampling is done with one timer counter per motor phase (A and B). The timer counters use two channels clocked at 50MHz. For each channel we use the “Burst signal” selection to have respectively XC0 (TCLK3) or (TCLK4) XC1 ANDed with the counting clock. The channel 0 of the same timer is used as reference to trigger a periodic interrupt for sampling, here every 4µs. This first sampling act as first SINC1 filter with OSR1=50. A digital third order CIC filter (also known as SINC3) is used to do anti-aliasing filtering and decimate to the desired data-rate​. This filter is applied on every SINC1 samples (OSR2=5). With this configuration we get SINC3 samples every 20µs which corresponds to 2.5 samples per PWM periods. The final calculation for phases A and B currents is performed in the FOC control interrupt routine. The currents are calculated with a weighted average on the last 4 samples. The FOC control loop is executed in an interrupt routine generate by a timer counter. This counter starts when the PWM event signal is raised. Then the interrupt is triggered after 20µs using the timer compare mode. This ensures that we have at least one current SINC3 sample calculated before the weight average calculation. ",
